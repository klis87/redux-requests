# Examples

For examples to work make sure you ran the following commands in the project root

```
yarn run install
yarn run build
```


Examples in this package take advantage of [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces), so you can install
`node_modules` for all examples with just one `yarn install` command from this directory. If you don't use `yarn`, that's
fine too, just run `npm install` in an example directory, as usual.
